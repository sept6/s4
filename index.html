            <p>It's been almost three years of togetherness, togetherness of happy moments, togetherness of sad moments, togetherness of fight üòÅ.
              But the thing that constant was togetherness.. from the sharing of food to sharing of rooms.. from chattings to calls.. from calls to 
              video calls.. everything got so much connected with each other and gradually changed and we became the priorities for each other.
            </p>
            <p>That saturday outings to sec 17's outing.. We trust each other and we did trust on our divine.. such that we have completed three years of 
              togetherness..
            </p>
            <p>Plan to bhut the lekin,, sb is lockdown k kaarn fail ho gya... I always pray to God that please help us to be together in future such that 
              we plan more and more surprises for each other as well as for our families.
            </p>
            <p>I wish that, you will get success, health, happiness in your life and by that you will lighten my life as well.</p>
            <p><strong>Happy 3 years of togetherness bae...</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Love you... ‚ù§</strong></p>
